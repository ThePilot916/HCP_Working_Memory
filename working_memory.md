# Description and differences between types of memory
	- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2657600/
		- long term memory: prior store of events vast amounts of it
		- short term memory: easily accessible temporary memory, not necessarily perceived
			- retained only as long as firing activity is mainted by the cell assembly
				https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2657600/#R56
			- proposed to decay as a function of time unless the memory is activated again
			- subset of the activated memories focused by attention is working memory?
		- working memory: coined by https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2657600/#R69
			- distiction between short term and this isn't as clear
			- needed for planing and active manipulation
			- mental arithematic, conversation
			- baddeley and hitch: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2657600/#R4
				- said all forms of temporary memory couldn't be accounted by a single module
					- presented the three master/slave system with central executive acting as master
					and verbal/phonological loop acting as one component of the slave and visiospatial sketchpad
					as another component of the system. Memory representations for these categories were handled by
					different brain areas but were managed and manipulated by CE
					- CE has its own memory irrespective of type of memory representation - episodic buffer as general memory store
						- was added to explain cross domain associations so achieved by the brain (names and faces)
			- long-term working memory: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2657600/#R48
										https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2657600/#R67
				helps explain how remembering something abstract but if parts are relatable then its easier than if none of them can
				be related to any long term memory

			- working memory capacity as CE attention controller https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2657600/#R46
			- working memory capacity dependent on control of attention management of primary and secondary memory
				- lack there of maybe the reason for ADHD? or rather abrupt attention management and not lack of it per se

				1988, 1995, 2001, 2005 theorotical framework for working memory
					schematic representation of the linkage between long term, short term and attention mechanism as part of working memory
		- assesment of short-term memory limit factors like - capacity, duration of store
			- cognitive psychology - proposed store decay as f(t) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2657600/#R11
				- rehersal, long-term retrieval and temporal distinctiveness are contaminants for short term perf
					- covert verbal rehearsal
			- articulation and rehearsal determent without introducing interference
				https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2657600/#R28
				- suggests decay
			- long-term retrieval assiting working memory
				- strong evidence from Korsakoffâ€™s amnesia patients showing presence of short term memory with good
				last elements in the list recalled perfectly while adding delay causes loss in recall of the earlier elements
				- suggests short term memory decay too
				https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2657600/#R51
				https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2657600/#R15
			- alternative to decay theory could be temporal distinctiveness of recall cue,
			having multiple cues in short temporal separation causing intereference in recall of memories while for isolated
			ones there is none
			-- difference in distinciton between the fact that retrieval from short term is hindered as a result of temporal interference
			vs that of time decay? adding time delay while having the same number of units to recall? - gives time for covert rehearsal
			- collapse instead of decay between 5-10s for tone https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2657600/#R36
			- capacity limit 7+/-2 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2657600/#R67
			- Phonological loop store - decay as a function of time
			- Episodic buffer store - focus of attention  Cowan 1988, 1995, 1999, 2005
			- time limit and chunk capactiy seem to have combined effect as shown by chttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2657600/#R29
			- no significant interference is noticed across different domains of memory recall while present simultaneously in the task,
			instead interference is present if all the recall entities belong to the same task
				- argument against general cross domain short term memory store
				- interesting find about cross domain short term recall test https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2657600/#R70
					- visual color dot match array list, with digit recital task in between
					- no loss of performance in case of recital of random digits silently but significant loss when done out loud
						suspected shared mechanism causing the loss of performance to be focus of attention
			- memory recall of items in the beginning of the list shows activation of the hippocampal area know for long term memory store
				https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2657600/#R80		recency effect of last elements is present even in amnesiacs
			- memory recall if affected by irrelevant stimuli present in the task for subjects with low span where as for subjects with high
			span there is no difference https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2657600/#R85
			- working memory can just be stated to be the whole system of short term memory, preservation and manipulation there of

	- short term memory limits has growing evidence for chunk limits and has decay as a function of time still doesnt have any solid ground

IMPORTANCE OF ATTENTIONAL SYSTEM USED FOR STORING AND PROCESSING OF MEMORIES
	- efficiency and its use in working memory differs in individuals substantially


# Role of working memory in learning
	- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4207727/
		- large capacity but short lived sensory memory was formed regardless of attention and a longer lived but small capacity abstract working memory required attention
			https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4207727/#R13
		- assembly or system of storage and processing in service of holding information in an accessible form working memory - baddley hitch
		- verbal lists provided in spoken form were retained better compared to the verbal lists provided in printed form
			https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4207727/#R106
		- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4207727/#R27 Cowan 1988 proposses long-term memory, a subset of which was in an activated state (cf. Hebb, 1949), and within 
		  that, a smaller subset of which was in the focus of attention
		- effect of cognitive load on the length of list that can be recalled, or memory span, is a negative linear (i.e., deleterious) effect
			https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4207727/#R9
			verbal rehearsal process that is separate from attentional refreshing
		- limit occurs in the focus of attention(capacity limit), or because materials of similar sorts interfere with one another
		- no loss of memory due to decay in cases of known verbal cues, significant loss of memory for unfamiliar characters followed by mask to eliminate sensory memory
			- consolidation process in the latter could be due to strengthening of episodic memory trace based on attentional refreshing in the spirit of Barrouillet et al. (2011)
				- most important effect of this refreshing would not be to reverse the effects of decay temporarily, as Barrouillet et al. proposed, but rather to alter the rate of decay 
					itself
		- people are capable of making use of working memory in complex environments even past individual working memory chunk limits by utilizing higher level of abstracting for the
			detailed knowledge required. For example a sequence of 123 could simply be retained with one abstract chunk of "ascending order 1 till 3 digits".
				- have detailed memory in long-term and have one chunk represent high level abtraction there by reducing number of items to be retained in the working memory store
		- long term working memory was coined by erricson kinstch 1995
			ex: while have a conversation with a person and the conversation gets interuppted by a call, one can resume the conversation after the call with the "abstract idea about
			that person" acting as a cue to restart the converstaion - the same is not possible a few days later tho?
			- cowan 1995 termed it as virtual short-term memory which makes use of long term store
		- Why bother with the working memory capacity at all? because in cases with limited long term knowledge on the topic at hand, the ability to build and learn newer concepts
			is now dependent 
		
		- Mathematical models
			- temporal ration model of memory https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17638496/
			- network model of phonological loop and its timing https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0033-295X.106.3.551
			- models of verbal working memory https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22486726/
			- short term memory serial order start end model https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9721198/
			- Time based resource sharing theory model of working working memory https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21327362/
		- Working memory and learning
			- formation and linking of abstract concepts/ideas that co-exists in the working memory
				- binding of ideas happen specifically in the focus of attention
					https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23653420/
		- Fallacies in reasoning and working memory performance
			https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4207727/#R130
			Confirmation bias
			- participants were given a set of cards with one face having a letter and the other one having a number and are asked which cards must be turned over to assess a rule
				participants failed to consider only picking the cards that disprove the rule

# CONCLUSION
	- Working memory is the retention of a small amount of information in a readily accessible form, which facilitates planning, comprehension, reasoning, and problem-solving
	- uncertainity is still prevalant regarding what limits working memory, whether its the concurrent holding capacity, interference, decay or mnemonic processing speed
		or an ensemble of them
	-	Breakdown of working memory largely seems to spiral towards involvement of an domain agnostic episodic buffer as suggested by baddely, sustained activation of memories,
		and a subset of active memories under the focus of attention.
